CF Utils for Vim was born out of the frustration with trying to write modern CF in Vim. Existing versions of the cf.vim syntax file don't support things like script based CFCs.

With CFML Utils, I also wanted to turn give Vim some basic functions found in ColdFusion Builder extensions. Things like the QueryParam Scanner and VarScoper extensions are awesome features and make debugging legacy (or poorly written code) a breeze. In future versions of CF Utils, I also want to add basic RDS support to make general debugging easier in Vim.
